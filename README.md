I created this because i have an artnet controller and wireless dmx lights i wanted to use in my home, you can create presets for fixtures and groups of fixtures, with live feedback when setting up, that then can be saved and recalled either by a set time or by astronomical time (sunrise/sunset by zip code or exact location) ill be uploading the docker container for the dotnet website, ill give you commands/compose at some point, but you can also just build it pretty easily
